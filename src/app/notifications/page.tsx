// This file is no longer needed as notification display is handled by a Sheet in ClientLayoutWrapper.
// You can safely delete this file from your project structure.
// If you prefer to keep it as a fallback or for other reasons,
// ensure its content is appropriate or redirect to home.

// For example, to redirect to home:
/*
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default function NotificationsPageRedirect() {
  redirect('/');
  return null; // Or a simple loading message
}
*/

// For now, I will leave it empty. You should decide whether to delete it or add a redirect.
// If deleted, also remove its entry from sitemap.xml and any direct links to it.
